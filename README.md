Ruby On Rails Blog Web App

But It started From a Funny Idea , That I want to everyone can write anything & edit or delete other posts !

You can write your posts on this blog & manage other posts ! it's simple , all of the peoples are admin ! it's creepy , I know ! but it's have a lot of fun so I called this project ( Fun Blog )

You can register , login , logout , edit your posts , edit other posts , delete them ...
